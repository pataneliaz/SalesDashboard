## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Increase stock and marketing focus in Q3–Q4** to leverage peak seasons.
2. **Evaluate high-discount products**—discounts may not always lead to profitability.
3. **Promote high-performing products** and **discontinue underperformers** after analysis.
4. Consider **region-wise targeting** to improve sales in low-performing areas.
5. Expand on high-performing categories like **Technology and Furniture** with upsell and cross-sell campaigns.
